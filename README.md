# Jammming

Jamming is a React Application that allows users to create and save Spotify playlists using search results with track analysis information such as BPM and Key. It also allows users to generate entire playlists based on the input of one track. 


## Installation

Clone the git repository into your local text editor. 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Which runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


## Usage

This application seeks to make Spotify an accessible platform for DJs to prepare detailed playlists for their sets. Jammming takes advantage of The Spotify API which contains a lot of information regarding track analysis that DJs use to organize their sets.

In the future I would love to be able to include track previews to give users a better experience when planning their sets.
